# Introduction to Buffer Overflow
Also known as a data overflow

is a flaw in which an external agent can manipulate data and temporary storage in order for the program to maliciously crash or be able to create a remote that is unauthorized.

This happens because when the program writes data in a reserved space of memory (buffer), it ends up exceeding this limit of the buffer on the adjacent memory. This is a simple example of a buffer overflow.
